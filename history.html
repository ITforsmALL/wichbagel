<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Big Sal was growing up on the south side of boston, he never imagined that bagels would save his life.</p>
<br>
<p>Sal's family was broke, but he was rich with friends and loved ones. Sal and his friends used to play on the rooftops in Southie, and jump from roof to roof, challenging each other.</p>
<p>One day, Sal slipped and hung from a utility pole while his friends watched in fear. Eventually Sal couldn't hold on any longer, and he plummeted through an awning -</p>
<p>but instead of crashing on the sidewalk, he landing right in the back of a huge truck filled with fresh bagels.</p>
<p>Even though it took Sal a few hours to eat his way out of that truck, from that moment he never turned down a bagel.</p>
<p>Fueled by this passion, Sal completed culinary school in New York, and opened his first Wich Bagel in 1996. With the help of those same friends who jumped from rooftops with him,</p>
<p>Wich Bagel has become a smashing success</p>
