<p>Wich Bagel is the award winning bagel sandwich shop that your friends talk about all the time!
Since 1999, Wich Bagel has won the Silver or Gold "Dough for Dough" award in each and every year. Wich Bagel has also been featured in magazines
such as "Ladles and Bagels", "Nobody Likes the Center", and "Bagel, Bagel, Bagel".
</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on using the freshest ingredients, and the most innovative techniques to produce an incomporable product.
You will never get a bagel at Wich Bagel that's more than 12 hours old. That is our promise to you! All of our remaining inventory is donated to 
local charities and soup kitchens.
</p>
<p>Owned and operated by Sal "Sam" Wich, and staffed by his family and friends - it's more than a shop - it's family.  Future plans include nation-wide sales of bagels,
as well as expanded locations, and possibly frachise opportunities!
