<p><h2>Wich Bagel is the award winning bagel sandwich shop that your friends talk about all the time!</h2><br>
Since 1999, Wich Bagel has won the Silver or Gold "Dough for Dough" award in each and every year. <br>Wich Bagel has also been featured in magazines
such as "Ladles and Bagels", "Nobody Likes the Center", and "Bagel, Bagel, Bagel". <br>The New York Times raved "It's a Bagel so good, it's featured in the New York Times".
</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on using the freshest ingredients, and the most innovative techniques to produce an incomporable product. <br>All of our ingredients are sourced from local and regional growers and farms. The only frozen inventory in our shops is ice.
You will never get a bagel at Wich Bagel that's more than 12 hours old. <br>That is our promise to you! All of our remaining inventory is donated to 
local charities and soup kitchens.
</p>
<p>Owned and operated by Sal "Sam" Wich, and staffed by his family and friends - it's more than a shop - it's family. <br>Our original location produces more than 30,000 bagels each week, and serves our entire community.
<br>Future plans include nation-wide sales of bagels,
as well as expanded locations, and possibly frachise opportunities! 
</p>
<p>In addition to all of our unenjoyed bagels being donated to local charities, 10% of all proceeds are donated to community causes and charities across the region.
